## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for production
export BINANCE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export BINANCE_API_SECRET="your_api_secret_here"

# Database security
export DB_PASSWORD="strong_random_password"
export DB_SSL_MODE="require"

# Redis security
export REDIS_PASSWORD="strong_random_password"

# Dashboard security
export DASHBOARD_SECRET_KEY="strong_random_secret_key"
export DASHBOARD_PASSWORD="strong_password"
```

### Database Security

```sql
-- Create dedicated user with minimal privileges
CREATE USER trading_bot_user WITH PASSWORD 'strong_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE trading_bot TO trading_bot_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO trading_bot_user;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO trading_bot_user;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO trading_bot_user;

-- Enable SSL
ALTER SYSTEM SET ssl = on;
ALTER SYSTEM SET ssl_cert_file = '/path/to/server.crt';
ALTER SYSTEM SET ssl_key_file = '/path/to/server.key';
```

### Network Security

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml security settings
services:
  trading_bot:
    environment:
      - DASHBOARD_SECRET_KEY=${DASHBOARD_SECRET_KEY}
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8000:8000"  # Bind to localhost only
    networks:
      - trading_bot_network
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
      - /var/tmp
```

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Log Monitoring

Monitor these log patterns for security issues:

```bash
# Failed authentication attempts
grep "authentication failed" /var/log/trading_bot.log

# Unauthorized API access
grep "403\|401" /var/log/trading_bot.log

# Suspicious trading patterns
grep "risk_event" /var/log/trading_bot.log

# Database connection issues
grep "database connection" /var/log/trading_bot.log
```

### Metrics to Monitor

- **Authentication Failures**: Track failed login attempts
- **API Rate Limits**: Monitor rate limit violations
- **Risk Events**: Track risk management triggers
- **System Errors**: Monitor for system-level issues
- **Network Traffic**: Monitor for unusual patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools

### Recommended Tools

- **Vault**: For secret management
- **Prometheus**: For metrics monitoring
- **Grafana**: For security dashboards
- **ELK Stack**: For log analysis
- **Fail2ban**: For intrusion prevention

### Security Scanning

```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scan
pip install safety
safety check

# Code security scan
pip install bandit
bandit -r bot/

# Docker security scan
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  aquasec/trivy image trading_bot:latest
```

## üìã Security Best Practices

### Development

1. **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
2. **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates of all dependencies
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
5. **Logging**: Log security-relevant events

### Deployment

1. **Least Privilege**: Run with minimal required permissions
2. **Network Isolation**: Use private networks where possible
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated
